						<h2>Connect with your community through local events</h2>
						<p>Discover your community and make connections with others by taking part in local events! Dis &bull; cover is an app that aims to help with the Syrian refugee crisis by making the transition into Canadian culture an enjoyable, social experience. This app brings public city events into one consolidated and easy-to-read mobile application so that users can check in to see what classes, events, and activities are being put on by city services like libraries, rec centres, parks, and more so that those who are new to living in Canada have ample opportunity to get out and connect with their communities! </p>

						<h3>get directions</h3>
						<p>Dis &bull; cover also helps those new to Canada familiarize themselves with their neighbourhood and city by displaying all events on a readable map. Users can see their current location, the location of events, street names, and highlighted travel routes when events are selected. Our app encourages going out and walking through areas to get to know new environments better. However, if cars and public transit are more appealing, any selected location can easily be opened up in Google maps for more travel options.</p>

						<h3>online discussions</h3>
						<p>All across the globe people are connecting with each other every day and in Dis &bull; cover people continue to do that through the event discussions. Not only are users able to meet new people at local events, they can start the process online through the conversations on each event page. Share your excitement, ask questions, and meet others who will be attending to prepare yourself and learn all the ins and outs to have the best time discovering what your community has to offer!</p>

						<h3>learn English</h3>
						<p>One of the most difficult parts of integrating into a new country is learning a new language. Dis &bull; cover helps get users familiar with their new communities and also their new language. Throughout the app are translations between English and Arabic with event pages able to be fully translated at the swipe or tap of a finger to quickly compare communication styles and learn key English words and phrases while using Dis &bull; cover.</p>

			<h3 class="header-intro">Inspired by the recent Syrian refugee crisis</h3>
			<h3 class="process-title">Domain: Immigrants</h3>
			<p>The domain for this project will look into the connectivity and integration of immigrants or newcomers in BC, Canada. To start a new life in a foreign country can be a frightening experience, one that is full of uncertainties. Especially to those who have gotten used to a certain lifestyle, who must now re-adjust to fit into the Canadian Western culture way of life.</p> 

			<p>There are variables and determinants affecting how immigrants integrate into Canada, a few according to StatsCan being: socioeconomic and cultural environment, immigration entry status, post-migration experience and demographic characteristics. For this project, we will be looking specifically into cultural environment and post-migration experience. We are looking to design an app that will aid immigrants into adapting to their new surroundings by meeting communities of similar backgrounds and finding familiar things that remind them of home. This way they can slowly integrate into their new lifestyle while still keeping into touch with their root heritage.</p>

			<h3 class="process-title">Brainstorm</h3>
			<p>For our interactive system we found the main issue was isolation so we thought that the following mobile apps can help connect immigrants to their communities:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Community social media platform
					<ul class="description">
						<li>Find other immigrants in your area: users can sign up and connect with new and old immigrants in their area. They are able to create social groups to connect with one another and meetup for events. The app can show them local restaurants and events happening in their area. Kind of like facebook events, but Facebook isn’t able to filter the people you are connecting with.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Service finder App
					<ul class="description">
						<li>
							App that shows local grocery stores, restaurants, bus stops etc in their area. Helps the person get used to the area they live in and see what is around them and what they can access. It will give them relevant information for the place they are going, example cash only, bus stop fares, etc. Those with the app can leave comments and information based on their experience and what anyone else would need for help in an area. Like “Yelo” users can ask questions about a store or area, and the community can give them a response. 
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Volunteer app
					<ul class="description">
						<li>The app lets the user sign up and then shows them possible volunteer opportunities in their area. User is able to sign up and list out their skills, the app will then show them all possibilities in their area. Will also show them how to get there by transit and the accompanying transit fares. Reverses the role so that they are able to give back to the community if they are already being helped by certain volunteer facilities.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ol>

			<h3 class="process-title">Iterations</h3>
			<p>During our feedback session we found that the Service Finder app was the most useful since they are not familiar with nearby services. Furthermore some local point of interest that cater to immigrants might not have a strong online prescence so through the app they would be able to see what was available for them.</p>
			<p>We split up the main services to eight major categories: </p>
			<ol>
				<li>Immigration services</li>
				<li>Community centres</li>
				<li>Grocery/markets</li>
				<li>Hospitals</li>
				<li>Mosques</li>
				<li>Restaurants</li>
				<li>Gym/Recreational centres</li>
				<li>Public parks/arenas</li>
			</ol>
			<figure>
				<img src="img/Sketch-1.jpg" alt="first iteration sketch">
				<figcaption>First iteration sketches where they can filter out which services they want and the initial home screen</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>After user feedback we discovered that our app's scope was too large to handle and it did not solve the isolation problem by offering them local services. Thus we focused more on local non-profit organization held events. Through these events they can meet others with similar background and interests. Our app would be able to help them track and find out more about these events so they can slowly integrate into the community.</p>


			<h3 class="process-title">User testing</h3>
			<p>To test our app design, we conducted several user tests with older generation Canadian immigrants between the age of 35-50 years old. Users were tasked with navigating through the app prototype to search for an event, open up more detailed information, and find out how to get to their selected destination. In every single user test the tasks were achieved quickly with minimal confusion.</p>

			<p>The most common feedback we received was that the interface was too small which made some aspects difficult to read and physically interact with, especially on the main map. Because of this, the information that used to appear directly on the map page is now only in the main event page alongside all of the main information so that the map is cleaner and there is more space for larger event destination tags.</p>

			<p>Pages like the event information page and directions page also did not have enough information for our users so deliberation was put into what key informaiton would be needed and what should be left for checking out on the events own websites.</p>

			<p>Lastly, from interviews we also learned that most people are already most comfortable using Google Maps for navigating to new places. Rather than try to create a new navigation service or copy existing ones, when users select an event the most direct walking route from their current location will become highlighted but more detailed information can be accessed through the navigation button that opens the event address the users' choice of navigation application that they already have installed.</p>


			<h3 class="process-title">Outcome</h3>
			<p>The outcome of months of researching, designing, iterating, and testing have culminated into Dis &bull; cover, an app made in response to the call to action to help Syrian refugees not only escape from conflict zones but also re-settle and become part of caring new communities. The simple but resource-filled app familiarizes Canadian immigrants with their new communities by connecting users with other users of the app and long-time Canadians at community events. </p>
